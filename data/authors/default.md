Hi I'm Viet, AI Engineer at [TopCV](https://www.topcv.vn/).

This blog is where I update my life events, my thoughts and knowledges.

Welcome!

> The Brain is wider than the Sky  
> For put them side by side  
> The one the other will contain  
> With ease and you beside
>
> The Brain is deeper than the sea  
> For hold them Blue to Blue  
> The one the other will absorb  
> As sponges Buckets do
>
> The Brain is just the weight of God  
> For Heft them Pound for Pound  
> And they will differ if they do  
> As Syllable from Sound
